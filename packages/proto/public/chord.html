        Well, you shouldn't talk to yourself
                             A
        Well, I pictured somebody else
                                C
        Someone that looks like

        What I look like

        G                                    Em7
        Would you say that one of your dreams
                                     A
        Got in you and ripped out the seams?

                            C
        That's what I'd say
        
        That's what I'd say
