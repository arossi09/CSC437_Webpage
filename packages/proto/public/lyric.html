        Well, you shouldn't doctor yourself<br>
        Well, I pictured somebody else<br>
        Someone that looks like<br>
        What I look like<br>
        Would you say that the one of your dreams<br>
        Got in you and ripped out the seams?<br>
        That's what I'd say<br>
        That's what I'd say<br>
        He was a sucker for your double dose<br>
        Mother----- turned white as a ghost<br>
        Don't you say hi<br>
        Don't you say hi<br>
        With a broken sink for a face<br>
        And a head that just takes up space<br>
        He's not half right<br>
        He's not half right<br>
        It's already half past<br>
        And it won't last<br>
        I was sticking up for my friend<br>
        When there's nothing much to defend<br>
        It's a lost fight<br>
        It's a lost fight<br>
        'Cause when I talk to you on the phone<br>
        Well, it's just like being alone<br>
        It's not half right<br>
        It's not half right
        </p>
