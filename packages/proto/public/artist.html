        <h3> Description </h3>
                <p>Steven Paul Smith (August 6, 1969 â€“ October 21, 2003), known
                as Elliott Smith, was an American musician and singer-songwriter.
                He was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and
                lived much of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he gained popularity.
                Smith's primary instrument was the guitar, though he also played piano, clarinet,
                bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. He had a distinctive vocal style
                in his solo career after Heatmiser, characterized by his "whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery",[5]
                and often used multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies that were usually
                finger picked and recorded with tape.</p>
